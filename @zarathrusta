 Zarathrusta's heart was filled with love
 and he went to the people.
 He saw a young man near a tree visibly
 bothered with  contradiction that bubbled in
 him violently

 Zarathrusta: You seem in discomfort
 Man: Oh, Zarathrusta. What have I become?
 The young man hesitated to say anymore -
 but began to mumble of his own accord

 Man: What have I made of myself? Nothing remains
 in mine control, and nothing moves by my accord
 Zarathrusta: Even mountains move on accord of the
 Ubermensch
 Zarathrusta understood the man didn't absorb the
 nutrition of his words

 Zarathrusta: This tree, do you see?
 Man: This? Yes.
 Zarathrusta: Man is like this tree.
 Man: How do you say so?
 Zarathrusta grabs the trunk of the tree and attempts
 to shake it

 Zarathrusta: Does the tree move?
 Man: No
 Zarathrusta: But the wind that you can barely see,
 does it not bend and break the tree on its accord?
 The man lightens up

 Man: Zarathrusta, yes it does.
 Zarathrusta: Man is a tree - he is bend and moved
 by invisible forces. To surpass them is
 to embrace the Ubermensch.

 The young man became delighted and found assurance
 in his chaos. Zarathrusta shook his hand and became
 determined to teach to the people about the Ubermensch.
