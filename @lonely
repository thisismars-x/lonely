Have you ever wanted to whip a TUI or terminal based
application but were disgusted by what's out there?

lonely is a TUI framework to build full terminal based
applications. 
Easy? Fast? Intuitive? Low bloat? Expressive? 
Yes. To all.

What is different? Well.
HTML/ CSS what do they do? Build applications
SDL/ Raylib/ SFML/ Pygame what do they do? Build applications
What's the difference? 
HTML/ CSS are declarative languages
SDL/ Raylib/ SFML/ Pygame are written in a procedural way

So? More complicated applications eventually require
some type of procedural method of writing to remain code-able.
Is that why we need Javascript? I think so.
TUIs are simple applications. Maybe the simplest, even!
But there have been no frameworks that enable the
user to write code in a more functional/ declarative way to
make writing code easier and more maintenable.

Therefore, lonely.
